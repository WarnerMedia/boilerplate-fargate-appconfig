      <h2>${config.body.subtitle}</h2>

      <p>This is a simple Node.js application running on AWS Fargate.  The service reads in two different configurations from the AWS AppConfig service:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>YAML Freeform</li>
        <li>Feature Flag</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="${config.body.image}">

      <p>The Freeform configuration is used to set things like the page title, header values, and content images.  This kind of configuration could serve many purposes, such as setting API URLs, CDN base paths, etc.</p>

      <p>The Feature Flag configuration is used to enable or disable flags that can do things like activate and deactivate a new header and footer.  These flags also have attributes which can be used by the page, such as border and backgroung colors.</p>

      <p>For the purposes of this demostration, the configuration is being pulled in by the AWS SDK and the page is being build dynamically.  You could choose certain parts of the configuration to be exposed to front-end JavaScript.</p>

      <p>This application also has a simple caching mechanism to reduce the number of calls going back to AppConfig (in order to reduce costs).  AppConfig is billed based on consumption, so you want to keep consumption reasonable.</p>

      <p>The caching mechanism employed in this demonstration application may not be sufficient for a production environment; by default, it will get a new configuration on a regular interval (current default is 20 seconds).  It will also only pull a new configuration if a page has been requested, so a development environment which is idling will not be sending requests to AppConfig.</p>

      <p>Long term, it may be better to move to a push model where the application is notified of a configuration change, but for the demonstration site, just wanted to make the point that a caching layer of some sort should be implemented in order to reduce requests to AppConfig.</p>
